# CodeupCrypt

A sample project to practice TDD from scratch.

 - The hashing procedure should be pretty simple, just replace the original String's vowels with numbers, these are the rules:

| Chars 	| Replace 	|
|----------	|---------	|
| a or A  	| 4 	|
| e or E 	| 3 	|
| i or I 	| 1 	|
| o or O 	| 0 	|
| u or U 	| 9 	|
